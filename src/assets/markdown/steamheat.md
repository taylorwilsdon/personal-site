# Steam heat
### Subtitle
I’m going to start this out by issuing a caveat: as soon as the old school steam pros and the HeatingHelp forum types start reading this, there will inevitably be groans and sighs about how you’re doing it wrong and you should never be shutting off radiators, and rather focus your efforts on properly balancing your steam system. In a vacuum (there’s a pun in here somewhere), that’s completely true - what the pervasive conventional wisdom ignores, however, is the cold hard fact that the people who landed on this article are not homeowners in an 1800s Farmhouse in CT with their own steam boiler and personal system - it’s apartment dwellers in new york city, renting in a pre-war building alongside hundreds of other people with a steam system that’s been barely maintained over the years and an off-site superintendent who could not possibly be less interested in spending even one second of his day changing anything about the system. 

In such a case, as has been my own experience in multiple buildings, your only recourse is to be able to control the heat from within your unit, which is effectively impossible outside using the service valves to shut off the radiator entirely. That’s not ideal for any number of reasons - those valves are not meant to be used regularly, take forever to open and close and absolutely will degrade in a relatively short period of time if you are frequently twisting the wheel. 

So, what are our options?

TRVs, or Thermostatic Radiator Valves, are one of the most practical and renter-friendly solutions for gaining some semblance of control over the heat in your apartment without resorting to the nuclear option of shutting off the radiator entirely. These devices are designed to regulate the amount of steam entering the radiator by automatically adjusting the flow based on the ambient temperature in the room. Essentially, they act as a thermostat for individual radiators, allowing you to maintain a more consistent and comfortable temperature without overheating or freezing. Most options have the thermostatic controller attached to the vent itself, so you’re getting localized readings, but Honeywell/Residio does offer a remote TRV with a capillary wire that allows you to place the control and temperature sensor away from the radiator for more accurate readings. This is essentially a must if you keep your radiator under a cover (which I highly recommend for a variety of reasons) 

The beauty of TRVs lies in their simplicity and non-invasive installation. Most models are designed to replace the existing air vent on your radiator, which is the small valve that hisses and releases air as steam fills the radiator. By swapping this out for a TRV, you gain the ability to set a target temperature for the room. When the room reaches that temperature, the TRV restricts the flow of steam into the radiator, effectively throttling the heat output. When the room cools down, the TRV opens back up to allow more steam in. This passive, self-regulating mechanism makes TRVs an excellent choice for renters who can’t make major modifications to their apartment’s heating system.

However, there are a few caveats to keep in mind. First, TRVs are not a magic bullet. They can only control the heat output of the radiator they’re installed on, and they rely on the overall steam system being functional and reasonably balanced. If your building’s boiler is wildly inconsistent or your radiator is already receiving too much steam due to poor system maintenance, a TRV can only do so much. Additionally, TRVs work best in rooms with good airflow, as they rely on accurate temperature readings from the surrounding air. If your radiator is tucked behind heavy furniture or curtains, the TRV may not function optimally. Still, they are an excellent option and easy to DIY - we’ll cover that below. Expect to spend between $120 and $200 on a full TRV setup. 

For those looking to take things a step further, or for situations where TRVs alone aren’t cutting it, low-voltage motorized ball valves offer a more advanced—and admittedly more complex—solution. These devices are installed on the radiator’s supply pipe and allow for precise, remote control of steam flow. Unlike TRVs, which operate passively, motorized ball valves can be integrated into a smart home system, giving you the ability to control your radiator via a smartphone app or even automate heating schedules based on time of day or occupancy.

In summary, while the purists may scoff at the idea of controlling individual radiators rather than addressing the root cause of an unbalanced steam system, the reality for most NYC apartment dwellers is that the latter simply isn’t an option. TRVs and motorized ball valves represent two viable paths to reclaiming some control over your living environment, each with its own set of trade-offs. For those willing to experiment, these solutions can make a world of difference in turning your apartment from a sauna into a space that’s actually livable during the winter months.
